#Coursera Machine Learning: Regression

My solutions for the course : https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression/

##Regression Week 1: Simple Linear Regression Assignment

Predicting House Prices (One feature): <br />
In this notebook we will use data on house sales in King County, where 
Seattle is located, to predict house prices using simple (one feature) 
linear regression.

<b>Status: Completed</b>

##Regression Week 2: Multiple Linear Regression 

####Assignment 1
Predicting House Prices (Multiple Variables):<br />
In this notebook you will use data on house sales in King County to predict prices using multiple regression. The first assignment will be about exploring multiple regression in particular exploring the impact of adding features to a regression and measuring error.

####Assignment 2
Estimating Multiple Regression Coefficients (Gradient Descent): <br />
In this notebook we will cover estimating multiple regression weights via gradient descent.

<b>Status: Completed</b> 

##Regression Week 3: Assessing Performance

Polynomial Regression: <br />
In this notebook you will compare different regression models in order to assess which model fits best. 
We will be using polynomial regression as a means to examine the topic.

<b>Status: Completed</b>

##Regression Week 4: Ridge Regression

####Assignment 1
Observing effects of L2 penalty in polynomial regression:<br />
Run ridge regression multiple times with different L2 penalties to see which one produces the best fit. Revisit the example of polynomial regression as a means to see the effect of L2 regularization.

####Assignment 2
Ridge regression via gradient descent: <br />
Write gradient descent function to compute the regression weights given an initial weight vector, step size, tolerance, and L2 penalty.
