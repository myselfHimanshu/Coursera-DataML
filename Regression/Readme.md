In this notebook you will use data on house sales in King County to predict prices using multiple regression. The first assignment will be about exploring multiple regression in particular exploring the impact of adding features to a regression and measuring error.

####Assignment 2
Estimating Multiple Regression Coefficients (Gradient Descent): <br />
In this notebook we will cover estimating multiple regression weights via gradient descent.
