## Assignment 1: Regression: Predicting House Prices

Predicting house prices<br />
In this module, we focused on using regression to predict a continuous value (house prices) 
from features of the house (square feet of living space, number of bedrooms,...).

## Assignment 3: Clustering and Similarity: Retrieving Documents

Retrieving Wikipedia articles<br />
In this module, we focused on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text. We explored two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF.

## Assignment 4: Recommending Products

Recommending songs<br />
In this module, we focused on building recommender systems to find products, music and movies that interest users. Built an exciting iPython notebook for recommending songs, which compared the simple popularity-based recommendation with a personalized model, and showed the significant improvement provided by personalization.

## Assignment 5: Deep Learning: Searching for Images

Deep features for image retrieval<br />
In this module, we focused on using deep learning to create non-linear features to improve the performance of machine learning. We also saw how transfer learning techniques can be applied to use deep features learned with one dataset to get great performance on a different dataset.
